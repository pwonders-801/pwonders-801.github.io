                <h2>What are TTRPGs</h2>
                <p>TTRPGs, also known as tabletop role-playing games, are collaborative storytelling games in which the players role play as characters in a story led by the GM or Game Master.</p>
                <p>When the outcome of a character's actions are uncertain, dice are rolled according to the game's rule set. Within these rules, players are allowed the freedom to do what they want, and their choices shape how the story develops.</p>

                <h2>Who is involved in TTRPGs?</h2>
                <p>I play TTRPGs with a group of friends that I am comfortable with. Sometimes, I am a player in a game that someone else is running, and sometimes I act as a Game Master and guide my friends through a story and world that I created.</p>
                <p>Others might find people to play TTRPGs with through online forums or clubs. There are also many shows and podcasts where people post themselves playing TTRPGs, such as Critical Role, a podcast/show that has had two of its games adapted into an animated show that is released on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

                <h2>When can you play a TTRPG?</h2>
                <p>Most avid players of TTRPGs will tell you the scheduling is the worst part of the game. Getting several people to commit several hours of their time at the same time, on the same day, often weekly, is incredibly difficult and scheduling conflicts have been the death of many games.</p>
                <p>The 'when' of TTRPGs is simple. It's whenever you can make it happen.</p>

            <section id="where">
                <h2>Where can you play a TTRPG?</h2>
                <p>Traditionally, TTRPGs are done in person, often at the home of someone in the group. TTRPGs can sometimes be loud and doing one in public might be rude.</p>
                <p>However, because of COVID, many applications have been developed to allow TTRPGs to be played online, so location doesn't matter as much anymore, although, in my opinion, in-person games are more fun.</p>

            <section id="how">
                <h2>How do you play a TTRPG?</h2>
                <p>To play a TTRPG, you need a group to play with first. Once you have that, decide on a rule system to use and discuss what everyone is comfortable with. Then, the GM will either come up with a story or find a premade one, while the players make their characters. Then, the group schedules the game and begins to play.</p>
                <p>How you play a TTRPG depends on the rule system, but the basic idea is you decide what you want to do, you describe what you want to do, and then you roll some dice to determine if you succeed or fail.</p>

            <section id="why">
                <h2>Why play TTRPGs?</h2>
                <p>Like most games, TTRPGs are played for fun, but unlike most games, TTRPGs allow you to immerse yourself in another world and another person. The appeal of pretending to be someone else attracts a lot of people to TTRPGs.</p>
                <p>But what about the people who make the games? Game Masters normally have different reasons for running TTRPGs, some want to have a reason to hang out with their friends weekly, some find the creative aspect rewarding, and some find it just as fun as being a player.</p>
